# LLM-Based Input Validator

A production-grade Python script that leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash to validate user profile data. This project uses high-level prompt engineering instead of hardcoded logic to enforce data standards like E.164 and ISO-2.

## 🚀 Features
- **Zero-Library Logic**: All validation is handled by the LLM.
- **Structured Output**: Guaranteed JSON response format.
- **Automated Evals**: Integrated with `promptfoo` for testing.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the project** and navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd validator-py
